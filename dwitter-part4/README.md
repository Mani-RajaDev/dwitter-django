# Part 4 :Creating Forms and Handling Submissions

In this phase of the project, I implemented the ability for users to submit dweets through a Django form on the front-end, rather than just through the Django admin. I also added measures to prevent double submissions and handle errors, improving the overall user experience.

## Steps:
1. Modified the dashboard.html template to include a Django form for dweet submission.
2. Updated the dashboard view function in views.py to handle both GET and POST requests. For GET requests, the view renders the dashboard template. For POST requests, the view validates the form data and saves a new dweet to the database.
3. Added measures to prevent double submissions and handle errors in the form submission process, ensuring that the submission process is reliable and error-free.
4. Improved the front-end by adding a button in the user's dashboard that makes it easier for them to access their profile.

## Next Steps
Although the project was originally planned to be a four-part development process, the platform is currently invite-only. However, I will be implementing user registration and management to allow more users to join and engage with each other. Stay tuned for updates!
