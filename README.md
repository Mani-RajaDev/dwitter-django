# dwitter-django

Welcome to my social network app, developed using Django! This app allows users to post text messages and follow other users, similar to Twitter.

## Note 
The source code for each part of the project is available in separate subdirectories. You can find the detailed instructions for each part in their respective README files.

## Overview

The development process is divided into four parts:

1. Creating User and Profile Models: Set up the base project, extend the Django user model, and implement a post-save hook.
2. Designing Templates and Front-End Styling: Design a visually appealing user interface by creating a base template with Bulma. Create a dynamic list of all user profiles and enable easy access to individual profile pages.
3. Implementing Follows and Dweets: Allow users to follow and unfollow other profiles, create the back-end logic for dweets (user posts), and display them on the front end.
4. Creating Forms and Handling Submissions: Enable users to submit dweets through a Django form, prevent double submissions, handle errors, and improve the front-end user experience.

## Development Process

## Part 1: User and Profile Models

In the first part of the development process, I set up the Django project, extended the built-in user model, and set up the profile relationship model.

## Part 2: Designing Templates and Front-End Styling

In this part of the development process, I added a base template using Bulma CSS and implemented the ability to list all user profiles, access individual profile pages, and display the profiles a user follows and the profiles that follow the user.

## Part 3: Implementing Follows and Dweets: 

In this part of the development process,I added functionality that allows users to follow and unfollow other profiles, as well as created a backend logic for posting and displaying dweets on the user dashboard. This allows for a more engaging user experience, enabling users to easily connect with other users and share their thoughts through dweets.

## Conclusion

That's it for now! I'll continue to update this README.md file as I make progress on my social network app development project. Thank you for checking it out!
